  <h2>Mario</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Summmary-Mario is a short middleweight with relatively balanced attributes, possessing average walking and dashing speeds, as well as his air acceleration and weight, while his falling speed and gravity are slightly below average relative to the cast. However, he also has high air speed (tied with Sonic, Donkey Kong, Little Mac and Inkling for the 12th fastest) and jump height, but in exchange for poor range and low traction. These balanced stats do not give Mario the edge when it comes to overall movement, but they nevertheless make him adept at most situations where a key attribute is needed to gain the advantage, which when combined with his very quick frame data, grants Mario a great neutral game. As a result, despite his attributes implying a jack-of-all-trades type of character, Mario is somewhat more of a rushdown character in practice.

    Thanks to his incredibly quick attack speed, Mario shines in close-quarters combat. His fast attack speed allows him to consistently apply pressure to the opponent, and he is capable of quickly racking up damage once he gets the momentum, which is easy to do so on characters that cannot match his attack speed without getting heavily punished for it. Excluding his forward smash, forward aerial and special moves, all of Mario's moves have fast startup and low ending and landing lag (the latter in the case of his aerial attacks, except for his aforementioned forward aerial). All of his grounded moves are prime examples of his quick frame data: his neutral attack is his fastest move and an overall effective way to rack up damage, along with handy combo capabilities, while his up and down tilts are effective combo starters that can help rack up plenty of damage, and the former chains into itself at low percentages. All of his smash attacks are decent KOing options, as they can reliably KO at high percentages and have low ending lag; his forward smash has a powerful sweetspot located on the fiery explosion that he emits from his palm and possesses the highest power of all of his smash attacks, down smash is a semi-spike, making it useful for forcing opponents offstage, and up smash is very hard to punish due to its speed, power and slight disjoint due to the intangibility it grants on his head.
    
    Mario's aerial attacks are also very useful in many cases. Neutral aerial is a sex kick that can be useful in edgeguarding or for breaking combos. Back aerial has the longest reach and the highest knockback of Mario's aerial moves, allowing it to space effectively and reliably KO offstage. Up aerial's extremely quick startup, vertical launch angle and lack of sourspots let it combo into itself or other moves, on top of letting it easily break or set up combos. Mario Tornado, which is Mario's down aerial, is a great anti-juggling move that can also KO if used near the upper blast line. Finally, his forward aerial is a meteor smash with high base knockback for one, making it great for gimping all but the farthest-reaching of recoveries and being an extremely effective KO option offstage.
    
    His special moveset is highly varied and has plenty of uses. Fireball is a projectile with a decently long range. It can be useful in the neutral game or in edgeguarding, thanks to its disruptive knockback and downward trajectory, and is very useful for disrupting direct approaches. Super Jump Punch travels in a controllable diagonal direction and grants moderate distance, making it good at recovery. It also has intangibility upon startup, allowing it to be used out of shield very effectively. Due to its extremely quick startup, it is also a useful combo finisher, especially near the blast line. Cape reverses opponents, with the induced disorientation often being enough to allow a free hit or efficiently gimp a recovery, which aids in edgeguarding opponents. It is also a powerful reflector, making it highly useful in matchups against projectile-heavy characters, such as Simon or Samus. F.L.U.D.D. is a mechanism that shoots water, pushing opponents away, which compliments his Cape. Though situational, it can occasionally be used to give Mario some breathing space. As a result of his Cape, F.L.U.D.D. and his fast aerials, Mario also boasts a versatile edgeguarding game.
    
    Another valuable strength of Mario is his grab game. Even though his grab reach is only average, his grabs are fairly quick, and his pummel is fairly quick. His forward throw sends the opponent at a disadvantageous position, where Mario can capitalize on their mistakes. His up throw is a useful combo starter at lower percentages, comboing into his up, down, and back aerials. His back throw is by far his strongest throw and can reliably KO at around 160% near the ledge on any character, and even earlier with rage, is capable of killing at 107% in said situations. Finally, his down throw is a combo starter that can lead a vast amount of combo opportunities, most notably his up and forward aerials.
    
    Finally, and due to the favorable angles his moves send at, his tremendously quick frame data and his extensive amount of combo starters, Mario's combo ability is fantastic, and it is also worth noting that several of Mario's moves can lock, including his neutral attack. This makes it almost always imperative for Mario's opponent to tech all attacks at low to mid percentages when needed; otherwise, Mario can capitalize on the opportunity, and tack on unavoidable massive damage in the process.
    
    Despite Mario's numerous strengths, he is not flawless. Mario's attacks, while well-rounded, are not particularly exceptional, and most characters are able to outperform him in various areas: notable examples include Snake having a more versatile edgeguarding game, Joker having better comboing ability, Hero having a superior camping game, Zero Suit Samus having greater mobility, Roy having higher damage output per hit and Shulk having drastically larger reach. In particular, the latter is his main weakness: he has an overall poor reach in his attacks.
    
    His lack of reach prevents him from fighting at a safe distance and consistently forces Mario to approach characters on his own. This leads to having some difficulty against characters with large or disjointed reach, particularly swordfighters like Shulk and Lucina. As such, he will need to rely on close-quarters combat in order to fight decently against characters with disjoints. While back air is Mario's most effective spacing tool, it too suffers from a mediocre range that limits its utility against disjointed attacks.
    
    Mario can also have some difficulty in KOing, as he has few strong and reliable finishers and has difficulty in landing them, further compounded by his short reach, which limits his options, and a notable lack of KO confirms: outside of forward smash and up smash, none of his other moves are very reliable and consistently effective for KOing: his down smash can KO reliably only with its back hit and is unsafe on shield, while his aerials and Super Jump Punch can only KO at very high percentages or close to the blast zones, and while his back throw is strong, is very slow and easy to DI, and forward aerial is slow and must be sweetspotted (mid hit) in order to meteor smash, while the early hit and late hit (first and last active frame, respectively) have too much ending lag to be used as a combo extender while still being unreliable for KOing due to their rather low knockback. Because of this, Mario tends to rely too much on his forward and up smashes or reads to score a KO, and his inconsistent KO ability is further worsened by the changes to rage, which hinders him more than other characters, as it doesn't increase knockback as much as in SSB4, and since it no longer affects set knockback, he can't use his Super Jump Punch as a KO confirm at low percents anymore if he has high rage, similarly to Samus's Screw Attack. Because of this, he must keep his forward and up smashes fresh and be careful to not get predictable especially with the existence of stale-move negation. While his forward and up smashes are considered among the best of their type, they have their flaws too: the former has a sourspot located on Mario's arm, which while very difficult to hit with, it out prioritizes the sweetspot and has rather mediocre power, while the latter has poor range in front of him, and thus it can have trouble in hitting small or crouching characters.
    
    While his Fireball is useful in the neutral game for stopping approaches and is a decent edgeguarding tool, it's relatively weak for spacing and has noticeable ending lag, making it rather situational in comparison to other projectiles. Lastly, despite being known for his jumping ability (hence his original nickname, Jumpman), Mario's recovery is easy to gimp and is quite predictable. Despite his fast air speed and high double jump, Super Jump Punch, while fast and relatively safe, travels a merely average amount of vertical and horizontal distance. This means that if Mario is knocked off stage without his double jump, he is extremely vulnerable to edgeguarding and one hit could end his stock. This also leaves Mario very vulnerable to semi-spikes, as at high percents they will likely launch him too far to recover. Aside from Super Jump Punch, Mario has no other recovery options aside from utilizing Cape's momentum stalling as a mix-up. Nevertheless, Super Jump Punch still offers a serviceable amount of recovery ability and can get the job done if used properly.
    
    Overall, Mario has many clear strengths, and very few glaring weaknesses, resulting in his strengths outweigh his weaknesses. Despite being intended as a jack-of-all-trades character, his very quick speed overall and largely reliable combo ability allows him to get the edge easily against most characters, as it is hard to escape from him once he gets to combo the opponent while being easy for him to escape and regain the advantage. However, because of his low range, Mario must almost always fight in close-quarters, and often relies on reads to secure reliable KOs. Mario has to be very careful off-stage as well in spite of his viable edgeguarding game, as a single vent in his defenses can cause him to be unable to recover. Throughout the course of Ultimate's metagame, Mario has seen amazing results from players like Dark Wizzy, Prodigy, ANTi, MastaMario, Lui$, Teb and others, and is generally agreed to be competitively viable.
